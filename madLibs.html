        If you are traveling in [Foreign country] and find yourself having to cross a piranha - filled river, here’s how to do it safely.Piranhas are more [Adjective] during the day, so cross the river at night.Avoid areas with netted [Animal] traps – piranhas may be waiting there looking to [Verb] them! Piranhas are attracted to fresh [Type of liquid]and will migrate to it as often as possible.Whatever you do, if you have an open wound, try to find another way to get back to the [Place].
